OVERVIEW

	The *uima-common* package aims at *assembling common and generic code 
	snippets that can be usefully reused* in several distinct UIMA 
	developments (like analysis engine or any application).

	It is made of three parts 
	  * an  `CommonAE` class which extends `JCasAnnotator_ImplBase`.
	  * some UIMA Utilities 
	  * and some Java Utilities 

    *Why to use this package?*
    * you want *to develop type system agnostic analysis engines* and so to *handle generically the views and the annotations* you process. This is made possible by specifying the names of the handled views and annotations by parameters;
    * you want to *perform some process on some annotations* (also called _InputAnnotation_) *covered by some others* (also called _ContextAnnotation_) which are *only present in some views* (also called _InputView_);
    * you want to *create a new view* (also called _OutputView_) *or a new annotation* (also called _OutputAnnotation_) *to receive the processing result and you want to set their name generically*;
    * you want to handle  methods to get a view, an annotation type, a class, a feature, a feature getter method from their string name, to invoke an getter/setter method associated to a given annotation, or to create annotations from its name and feature name to set and views, or to subiterate with FeatureConstraints methods.
