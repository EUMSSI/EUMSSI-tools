INSTALLATION & USE INSTRUCTIONS

  * If you only want to use some of the generic methods you may consult 
  the [http://uima-common.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/index.html Javadoc] to 
  see the utilities offered by the UIMAUtilities and JavaUtilities classes

  * If you want to develop a generic AE, look at the 
  [http://code.google.com/p/uima-common/wiki/UserGuide UserGuide] to learn more
   on how to extend the `CommonAE`  class
  
  * In addition, you may consult the following examples which are extensions of 
  the `CommonAE` class and which consequently use also the UIMA and Java Utilities.
    * [http://code.google.com/p/uima-shell/source/browse/trunk/src/fr/univnantes/lina/uima/shell/ae/ShellAE.java ShellAE.java class] 
    of the [http://code.google.com/p/uima-shell/ uima-shell AE] project. 
    The descriptor examples illustrate various combination of generic parameters. 
    The Java code illustrates the extension of the processAnnotationFeatureStringValue 
    method and the use of parameters defined in the parent class.
    * The various [https://code.google.com/p/uima-connectors UIMA Connectors AE classes]
    * [https://code.google.com/p/uima-text-segmenter/source/browse/trunk/src/fr/univnantes/lina/uima/textSegmenter/TextSegmenterAE.java TextSegmenterAE.java] 
    and its two sub extension classes, [https://code.google.com/p/uima-text-segmenter/source/browse/trunk/src/fr/univnantes/lina/uima/textSegmenter/C99/C99AE.java C99AE.java]  
    and [https://code.google.com/p/uima-text-segmenter/source/browse/trunk/src/fr/univnantes/lina/uima/textSegmenter/JTextTile/JTextTileAE.java JTextTileAE.java].
